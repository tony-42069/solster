//! Bridge between production state and verified model_safety types
//!
//! This module provides conversions to enable production code to use
//! formally verified functions from model_safety.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - **model_safety**: Abstract, mathematically clean model with formal proofs
//! - **Production**: Complex Solana state with exposures, LP buckets, multiple vaults
//!
//! # Conversion Strategy
//!
//! 1. Portfolio → Account: Maps user-level state
//! 2. SlabRegistry → Params: Maps global parameters
//! 3. Aggregate vaults → vault field
//!
//! # Type Mappings
//!
//! | Production Field | Model Field | Notes |
//! |------------------|-------------|-------|
//! | Portfolio.principal (i128) | Account.principal (u128) | Convert via max(0, principal) as u128 |
//! | Portfolio.pnl (i128) | Account.pnl_ledger (i128) | Direct mapping |
//! | Portfolio.vested_pnl (i128) | Account.reserved_pnl (u128) | Convert via max(0, vested) as u128 |
//! | Portfolio.last_slot (u64) | Warmup.started_at_slot (u64) | Direct mapping |
//! | (Not mapped) | State.loss_accum/fee_index (u128) | Fee distribution state tracked separately |
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - **Vesting algorithms differ**: Production uses exponential, model uses linear
//! - **Global haircut**: Production tracks pnl_index_checkpoint, model doesn't
//! - **Position tracking**: Production has complex exposures, model has simple position_size
//! - **Multiple vaults**: Production has per-mint vaults, model assumes single collateral
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use model_safety;
//! use crate::state::model_bridge::*;
//!
//! // Convert portfolio to model account
//! let account = portfolio_to_account(&portfolio, &registry);
//!
//! // Use verified function
//! if model_safety::helpers::is_liquidatable(&account, &prices, &params) {
//!     // Execute liquidation using verified logic
//! }
//!
//! // For arithmetic, use verified math directly
//! use model_safety::math::*;
//! let result = add_u128(a, b);  // Saturating addition
//! ```
